## ABOUT ME

<p style="text-align: justify;
  text-justify: inter-word;">
    I’m a software engineer with over <b>four</b> years of experience and a Master’s in Data Science and Analytics from the University of Hertfordshire. My journey began in full stack web application development and has evolved into building practical AI systems that solve real-world problems.
    <br>
    Along the way, I’ve built scalable APIs, deployed machine learning pipelines, and worked on projects ranging from semantic search to real-time alerting systems. I enjoy working at the intersection of software and data, where curiosity and engineering come together to build something meaningful.
    <br>
    I’m always learning, always building, and always looking for ways to apply technology in impactful ways.
